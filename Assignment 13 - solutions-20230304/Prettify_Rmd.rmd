This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

# Example Analysis

In this example, we investigate a linear regression model to predict the `Sepal.Length` in the `iris` data set. 

## Data preprocessing

First, we have to load the data. Furthermore, we are transforming the variables into our target format.

```{r load data, eval=TRUE, show=TRUE}
# Loading the data
data(iris)
dat <- iris
```

As the data preprocessing might not be not so important for the interpretation, we can exclude them from the report with `include=FALSE`. 

```{r preprocessing, include=FALSE}
# doing some preprocessing, which is not important for the outcome
# converting variables into double
dat$Sepal.Length <- as.double(dat$Sepal.Length)
dat$Sepal.Width <- as.double(dat$Sepal.Width)
dat$Petal.Length <- as.double(dat$Petal.Length)
dat$Petal.Width <- as.double(dat$Petal.Width)
# Species into factor
dat$Species <- as.factor(dat$Species)
```


## Some insights from the data set 

First, we investigate, how many species we have. Below, you can see a table with species and their counts.

```{r overview, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
# Creating a table with all species and their counts 
table(dat$Species)
```

But of course, we can create a table 1 with e.g. the `qwraps2` package:

```{r table1, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results="asis"}
library(qwraps2)
options(qwraps2_markup = "markdown")
our_summary <-
  list(      "Sepal Length" =
    list("Min" = ~min(Sepal.Length),
         "Mean (SD)" = ~ qwraps2::mean_sd(Sepal.Length),
         "Max" = ~max(Sepal.Length)),
          "Sepal Width" =
    list("Min" = ~min(Sepal.Width),
         "Mean (SD)" = ~ qwraps2::mean_sd(Sepal.Width),
         "Max" = ~max(Sepal.Width)))

sum_dat <- dplyr::group_by(dat, Species)
summary_table(sum_dat, our_summary)
```


If you want to print a data frame, you can use `knitr::kable`, which will reformat the table nicely in the report.

```{r echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
tab <- data.frame(tapply(dat$Sepal.Length, dat$Species, mean))
colnames(tab) <- c("Mean (Sepal.Length)")
knitr::kable(tab, caption = "Table with Mean Sepal Length among species")
```

Great, it seems that the sample mean is different between the groups. [^1]

[^1]: This is not a formal test. For comparing the mean, a t-test should be applied.

In the next step, we are looking into the density plots. We will create them with `ggplot2`.

```{r dense plot, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(dat, aes(x=Sepal.Length, fill=Species, color=Species)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.3)
```

Cool, we have included a nice graph. 

## Linear Model

In the next step, we will fit a linear model, which is estimating the `Sepal.Length`. As variables, we include the `species`, the `petal` values and the `Sepal.Width`. We will also print the summary. We assume for the analysis a  significance level of $\alpha=0.05$ 

```{r linear_model}
fit <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species + Sepal.Width, data = dat)
summary(fit)
```

We can also print out a single output from our summary, if we want. We can call for instance in the summary some values. For that, we are using `print` and `paste` (for string concatenation). 

```{r Print Some Values, echo=FALSE, result="asis"}
sum <- summary(fit)

print(paste("R-Squared: ", round(sum$r.squared, 3)))
```

And again, we are including a nice table of the coefficients with `knitr::kable`.

```{r echo=FALSE, result="asis"}
knitr::kable(sum$coefficients, caption = "Coefficients table from `fit`.")
```


> **Findings (some example interpretations)**
>
> 1) The model has a p-value of < 2.2e-16, which is less than our significance level of $\alpha=0.05$.
> 2) The R-squared values is 0.726, so ~73% of the variance of sepal length can be explained by our model.
> 3) All coefficients has a p-value < $\alpha$ and are significant. 
> 4) The sepal length of  species "versicolor" are expected to be 1.45 larger than the species setosa.
> 5) With a sepal width increase of 1, we can expect an increase of 0.8 for the sepal length.
