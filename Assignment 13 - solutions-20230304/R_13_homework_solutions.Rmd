## Exercise 1: Survival analysis

**Task:**

Choose one other provided dataset in the survival package (or any other suitable dataset of interest) which contains time-to-event dataset. Use the survfit function to compute the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function and plot it. Then choose a variable with 2 or more categories in the dataset and perform a log-rank test. Interpret the results: is there are difference in survival between the groups?

**Solutions:** 

Do a survival analysis of the 'diabetic' dataset in the survival package, which contains data on the outcome time-to-visual loss, in a sample of patients with diabetic retinopathy that were treated with two types of laser treatment.


```{r}
library(survival)
dat <- diabetic

# look at data:
?diabetic
head(dat)
```

```{r}
# compute the Kaplan Meier estimate of the survival function
KM1 <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = dat)

# Look at the results (in table form)
summary(KM1)

# Look at the plot:
plot(KM1, main = expression(paste("Kaplan-Meier-estimate ", hat(S)(t), " with 95% CI")), ylab = "Survival function", xlab = "Time")

# Stratify this by treatment:
KM2 <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ laser, data = dat)
plot(KM2, main = expression(paste("Kaplan-Meier-estimate ", hat(S)(t), " stratified by sex")), ylab = "Survival function", xlab = "Time", lwd=2, col=1:2)
legend(x="topright", col = 1:2, lwd = 2, legend=c("xenon", "argon"))

# perform log-rank test:
survdiff(Surv(time, status) ~ laser, data = dat)
# Interpretation: no effect of treatment on the outcome = time-to-visual loss.
```
